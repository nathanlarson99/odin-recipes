            <li>1 cup uncooked rice</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="Steps">
        <li><span><em>Step 1</em></span><p>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a 12-inch skillet. Season both sides of pork chops with taco seasoning, cumin, smoked paprika, and salt.</p></li>
        <li><span><em>Step 2</em></span><p>Place chops in the hot skillet and cook, turning once, until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Remove to a plate, and keep warm.</p></li>
        <li><span><em>Step 3</em></span><p>In the same skillet, cook and stir onion and bell pepper, until the vegetables just begin to pick up a little color, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</p></li>
        <li><span><em>Step 4</em></span><p>Pour in diced tomatoes and green chilies, with their juices, and stir, being sure to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the skillet.</p></li>
        <li><span><em>Step 5</em></span><p>Add chili powder and black pepper to the chicken broth, and stir in.</p></li>
        <li><span><em>Step 6</em></span><p>Add thawed corn kernels, sliced zucchini, and uncooked rice. Stir until vegetables are evenly distributed, and make sure all the rice is submerged in the cooking liquid. Bring to a boil.</p></li>
        <li><span><em>Step 7</em></span><p>Nestle pork chops into the skillet contents, and add any accumulated juices from the chops. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer about 20 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><span><em>Step 8</em></span><p>Remove cover, and continue to simmer until rice is tender and all the liquid is absorbed, about 5 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of pork chops should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><span><em>Step 9</em></span><p>Garnish with flat-leaf parsley or cilantro and lime slices. Serve warm.</p></li>
